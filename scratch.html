    <p class="boss" class="mainblock">
        Welcome to my personal rankings of the best bosses in the "Souls" videogame series by fromsoftware.
        These are, of course, my personal favorites. I will give my reasoning below each ranking. Let me know
        if you agree or disagree with any of my choices! 
    </p>

    <ol>
        <div class="mainblock">
            <li><span class="boss">Orphan of Kos - Bloodborne</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Orphan's moveset is incredibly intense, unforgiving, and fast-paced, however, it is learnable. With some practice, mastering this fight will make you feel
                        like you are as skilled as a professional. That makes victory that much sweeter
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The lore implications of this fight are incredible. It is the culmination of the entire story's search for the power of the 
                        great ones. As the orphan is born from the great one, Mother Kos, a character mentioned throughout the story, you are faced with the task of slaying a great one in order to become a great one, yourself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, the atmosphere is unmatched. The bottom of the fishing hamlet, seemingly located in a nightmare below the hunter's dream, the beautiful ocean scene, and
                        serene, glowing moon, accompanied by a desparate battle, all contribute to the ominous atmosphere that fromsoftware is so good at creating. In my opinion, this is some of their best work.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class="mainblock">
            <li><span class="boss">Slave Knight Gael - Dark Souls 3</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Similar to the Orphan of Kos, Slave Knight Gael has an intense moveset. With how long the fight takes, mastering it becomes necessary, and by the end of the fight
                        you will have no trouble fighting him, even with him being arguably one of the hardest bosses in the series.
                    </li>
                    <li>This epic battle also shines in the lore department. Gael, a lowly slave knight, becomes your friend and ally throughout the game, helping you defeat various bosses
                        guiding you down the right paths. He ends up turning on you as he transitions from human to hollow, as seen by his dark, cannibalistic actions in the opening cutscene.
                        You are forced to fight your friend, and watch him go fully hollow mid-fight, as you now want to defeat him out of pity.
                    </li>
                    <li>Finally, the atmosphere is awesome. The arena is massive and Gael traverses the whole thing incredibly fast. It is located at the bottom of the ringed city, and the
                        phase transition brings about storms and lightning, adding to the intensity and emotion.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </div>
        <div class="mainblock">
            <li><span class="boss">Knight Artorias - Dark Souls</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Knight Artorias is one of the hardest bosses to learn in the whole series. I wouldn't call him a contender for hardest boss, but your first few tries
                        against him will almost certainly end in humiliation. He has an unusual, spoaradic moveset. He wields his sword with his left hand, times his attacks
                        very strangely, and will punish even the slightest of mistakes. Beating Artorias is very rewarding
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As with the others, the lore implications of this fight are immense. You hear about the legendary Artorias, the one who traversed the abyss, and Gwyn's
                        right hand man, the whole game. You finally find him, severely corrupted by the abyss, having all but lost his humanity. You come to defeat him, fulfilling
                        his quest and preserving his reputation, knowing it was truly you who successfully traversed the abyss and defeated Manus.
